Python is a popular, general-purpose programming language that is easy to read and code, making it an excellent choice
for beginners. It is widely used in fields like web development, machine learning, data science, and software development.

Having a portable Python installation offers several advantages over a traditional installation:
- Run multiple Python versions simultaneously without conflicts.
- Easily remove the installation when it’s no longer needed.
- Avoid changes to system files, the registry, or environment variables.
- Synchronize the installation across devices or teams via version control systems (e.g., SVN).
- Use Python on any PC—just copy the installation to a USB drive and go!

### Downloading & Installing Python

To set up a portable Python installation, we’ll use Miniconda. Follow these steps:
1. Download Miniconda:

    Visit the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers">Miniconda Windows installers page</a>
    and download the installer for your desired Python version.
2. Move the Installer:

    Place the downloaded `.exe` file in the directory where you want to install Python.
3. Open Command Prompt:

    - Navigate to the installation directory in File Explorer.
    - Press `Alt + D`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
    - Alternatively, on Windows 11, right-click in the folder and select **Open in Terminal**.
4. Run the Installer:

    Enter the following command in the Command Prompt, replacing the placeholder names with your specific file and folder names:
    ```
    Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Windows-x86_64.exe /InstallationType=JustMe /AddToPath=0 /RegisterPython=0
    /NoRegistry=1 /S /D=%~dp0Python38
    ```
    - Replace `Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Windows-x86_64` with the name of the downloaded installer.
    - Replace `Python38` with your desired folder name.

    Press Enter to execute the command. Miniconda will install Python into the specified folder (e.g., Python38).


### Creating batch file

To make it easy to access Python with the correct paths, create a batch file:

1. Navigate to the Installation Folder:

    Open the folder where you installed Python (e.g., `Python38`).

2. Create a Batch File:

    - Right-click in the folder and select **New > Text Document.**
    - Rename the file to `python.bat`.

3. Edit the Batch File:

    Open the `python.bat` file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad) and paste the following line:
    ```
    start cmd.exe /k "set PATH=%CD%;%CD%\Library\bin;%CD%\Library;%CD%\Scripts;C:\Windows\System32"
    ```
    Save and close the file.


Now, double-click `python.bat` to open a Command Prompt window with the Python environment set up. You can use `conda` or
`pip` to install packages and start using Python immediately.

### Optional: Create a Shortcut
For quick access, create a shortcut to the `python.bat` file and place it on your desktop or in your Start menu.
